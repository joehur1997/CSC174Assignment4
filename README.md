# Team Timbuktu Assignment 4

## Domain
The domain for the content in this website is college students.  Specifically, we learn about three college students named Amanda, Michael, and Tom.

## Ontology
- Each student has a major
- Each student has one or more minors
- Each student has a primary interest
- Each student has a collection of basic information they use to introduce themselves
- Each student has information about their academics
- Each student has information about their jobs
- Each student has information about their hobbies

## Taxonomy
The major, minor(s), and primary interest of each student will remain unlabeled with heading.  Choreography will clarify the related nature of these facts.  Similar phrase wording was used to try and emphasize the similiarity between these pieces of information.  We will call the collection of basic information for each student 'Introduction'.  The academic information for each student will be labelled "Academics'.  The career information for each student will be labeled 'Jobs'.  The hobbies information for each student will be labeled 'Hobbies'.

## Choreography
The major, minor(s), and primary interest of each student will be with a picture of the primary interest on each page in a list so they are readily interpreted as 'quick facts' about each student.  The first level navigation will be presented in alphabetical order by student name (with a home page as a good starting/landing page).  Then the second level navigation within each student will start with the Introduction as that is often an expected place to start, then the Academics page as that often dominates a university student's life, then the Jobs page as job responsibilities come second only to academics for most students, and lastly the Hobbies as these often come last for students and must fit in thier limited free time.  On the index page, only the primary interest photo and the 'quick facts' (major, minor(s), and primary interest) will appear for each student, and these will appear in alphabetical order like they are in the navigation bar.
