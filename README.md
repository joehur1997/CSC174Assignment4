# Team Timbuktu Assignment 4

## Domain
The domain for the content in this website is college students.  Specifically, we learn about three college students named Amanda, Michael, and Tom.

## Ontology
- Each student has a collection of basic information they use to introduce themselves
- Each student has information about their academics
- Each student has information about their jobs
- Each student has information about their hobbies

## Taxonomy
We will call the collection of basic information 'Introduction'.  The academic information will be labelled "Academics'.  The career information will be labeled 'Jobs'.  The hobbies information will be labeled 'Hobbies'.

## Choreography
The first level navigation will be presented in alphabetical order by student name (with a home page as a good starting/landing page).  Then the second level navigation within each student will start with the Introduction as that is often a good place to start, then the Academics page as that often dominates a university student's life, then the Jobs page as job responsibilities come second only to academics for most students, and lastly the Hobbies as these often come last for students and must fit in thier limited free time.
