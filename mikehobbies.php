	<h2>Hobbies</h2>
	
	<p> For hobbies I like casual cycling and kayaking, and sometimes I commit to jogging a couple times a week if it’s
		warm out. I used to play soccer and tennis in high school but I’ve only been playing intramural squash while at
		U of R. I follow the NBA most closely out of all the professional sports, but don’t have a favorite team – I
		usually bandwagon a team that isn’t Golden State. If I had to pick a favorite this year it’d be the Denver
		Nuggets. </p>
