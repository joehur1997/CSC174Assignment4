	<p> Freshman year I wasn’t sure what I wanted to major in so I chose a bunch of prerequisites and eventually ended up going towards geomechanics, which I eventually swapped out for environmental science sophomore spring. I didn’t enjoy many classes as an undergrad but eventually took the intro to Python course, CSC 161, which I liked enough to cram a CS minor into my degree. I’ve also completed clusters in European History and Russian Studies. My favorite class so far has been Hitler’s Germany (HIS 126) followed by Intro to Java (CSC 171), Vikings (HIS 125), and Engineering Statics (ME 120). </p>
