			I’ve taken a lot of courses (almost enough to graduate!) while at the U of R. One of my favorites was my first political science course, Game Theory. The course certainly wasn’t fun and games, but it did include a lot of interesting concepts such as the Prisoner’s Dilemma and other formalizations of problems. The entire course was focused on how decisions should be made when those decisions are dependent on other parties’ decisions. Another interesting course I took was called Research Practicum in Criminal Justice Reform. This course was much easier than Game Theory, but I learned a lot of practical knowledge from it. The course was partnered with a non-profit called Measures for Justice, and students were able to gain experience reading legal statutes and gathering data -- this would eventually be used by MFJ as part of their database intended to showcase data and abnormalities across county-level criminal justice systems.
