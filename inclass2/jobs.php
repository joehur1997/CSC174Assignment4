	<p> I’ve had two internships while at U of R, both in 2018. Over Spring break last year I worked at Chobani, a Greek yogurt company that has offices about 30 mins from Greene in Norwich, NY. I didn’t do anything related to yogurt, instead I copied and filed/digitized physical invoices for an upcoming audit. My other internship was during summer break, where I worked for a marketing company in Binghamton as an “inside sales representative.” Pickings are slim in Binghamton for student internships/coops unless you are in mechanical engineering (Lockheed Martin is nearby), so I went on Indeed and applied for a bunch of things until I got a response. At the company I talked to contractors/painters/landscapers/etc. over the phone on behalf of Lowe’s - direct business to business marketing where I would either update their contact info (so that we could send them stuff) or try to sell them a product. Telemarketing isn’t a very fun job since you either get a lot of voicemails or have the same conversation hundreds of times per day. I was surprised that I didn’t hate it but I probably wouldn’t want to do it as my career. </p>
