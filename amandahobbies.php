    <h2>Hobbies</h2>

    <p>In addition to my academic and curricular pursuits, I have a number of hobbies. I really enjoy dancing, and to
        keep up with this interest I have completed a Dance cluster as well as been a member of Ballet Performance
        Group. This semester, I hope to join Rochester Rangoli to learn a bit of Bollywood dance. I also really enjoy
        making different types of crafts, although I’ve had less time to pursue this activity as a college student. One
        of my favorite types of crafts is jewelry-making. In fact, I got my ears pierced in high school to justify
        keeping the pairs of earrings I had made and really liked. I also enjoy playing games, particularly hidden
        identity games. Some of my recent favorites have been Avalon and Tempel des Schreckens. I also enjoy playing my
        clarinet, ice skating, outdoor adventures, kayaking, and playing video games. I like how simple excursions
        become adventures if you do them after midnight or in a snowstorm, and I went to Wegman’s during Snowmaggedon.
