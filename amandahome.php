        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I am a student here at University of Rochester finishing up my major in Brain & Cognitive Sciences as well as minors in Computer Science and Psychology.  I knew coming into college that I wanted to major in Brain & Cognitive Sciences because it seemed like a combination of biology and psychology—two subjects I had loved in high school.  I had originally planned on double majoring in psychology along with my Brain & Cognitive Sciences major, but when I took The Science of Programming (CSC 171) as part of my Brain & Cognitive Sciences program I loved it and decided to stick with it.  I’m very glad I took that class early on in my college career so that I was able to add a Computer Science minor and explore that newfound interest.</p>
