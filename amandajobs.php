        <p>I’ve held a number of different jobs since beginning my college career.  My first research job was with the Approach-Avoidance Motivation Research Group.  My first summer job was working as a summer camp counselor at Mount Hope Christian School.  Then I worked as a teaching assistant for BIO 110, and then I worked as a teaching assistant for PSY 161.  Then I worked for a year at the Kid Neurolab, helping conduct fMRI research on children’s mathematical abilities.  Then I worked at Yale’s Computation and Cognitive Development lab for a summer.  This year, I’ve been working as a Peer Advisor for the Brain & Cognitive Sciences department, as well as a Teaching Assistant for Machines & Consciousness.</p>
