        <p>I am a student here at University of Rochester finishing up my major in Brain & Cognitive Sciences as well
            as minors in Computer Science and Psychology. I knew coming into college that I wanted to major in Brain &
            Cognitive Sciences because it seemed like a combination of biology and psychology—two subjects I had loved
            in high school. I had originally planned on double majoring in psychology along with my Brain & Cognitive
            Sciences major, but when I took The Science of Programming (CSC 171) as part of my Brain & Cognitive
            Sciences program I loved it and decided to stick with it. I’m very glad I took that class early on in my
            college career so that I was able to add a Computer Science minor and explore that newfound interest.</p>
        <h2>Classes</h2>
        <p>I’ve taken a large variety of different classes here at University of Rochester, and some of them were
            easier than others. In the following paragraph I will describe some of the classes that were the most
            difficult for me. Artificial Intelligence was one of the most difficult classes I’ve taken at U of R,
            because there was a lot of dense material on the exams. Basic Neurobiology was also a very difficult class
            because of the large amount of dense material on the exams. For each of these two classes there were 4
            units, and I think each unit could have been a class all its own.</p>
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>In addition to my academic and curricular pursuits, I have a number of hobbies. I really enjoy dancing, and
            to keep up with this interest I have completed a Dance cluster as well as been a member of Ballet
            Performance Group. This semester, I hope to join Rochester Rangoli to learn a bit of Bollywood dance. I
            also really enjoy making different types of crafts, although I’ve had less time to pursue this activity as
            a college student. One of my favorite types of crafts is jewelry-making. In fact, I got my ears pierced in
            high school to justify keeping the pairs of earrings I had made and really liked. I also enjoy playing
            games, particularly hidden identity games. Some of my recent favorites have been Avalon and Tempel des
            Schreckens. I also enjoy playing my clarinet, ice skating, outdoor adventures, kayaking, and playing video
            games. I like how simple excursions become adventures if you do them after midnight or in a snowstorm, and
            I went to Wegman’s during Snowmaggedon.</p>
        <h2>Jobs</h2>
        <p>I’ve held a number of different jobs since beginning my college career. My first research job was with the
            Approach-Avoidance Motivation Research Group. My first summer job was working as a summer camp counselor at
            Mount Hope Christian School. Then I worked as a teaching assistant for BIO 110, and then I worked as a
            teaching assistant for PSY 161. Then I worked for a year at the Kid Neurolab, helping conduct fMRI research
            on children’s mathematical abilities. Then I worked at Yale’s Computation and Cognitive Development lab for
            a summer. This year, I’ve been working as a Peer Advisor for the Brain & Cognitive Sciences department, as
            well as a Teaching Assistant for Machines & Consciousness.</p>
