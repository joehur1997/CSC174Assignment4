	<h2>Jobs</h2>

	<p>
		I’ve had a couple different jobs throughout college. The first, after my freshman year of college, ties into one
		of my biggest passions: Soaring. I spent the summer as a commercial glider pilot, flying passenger rides in
		small, unpowered aircraft. After returning to school for sophomore year, I got a job as a Speaking Fellow. This
		involved taking a 4-credit course in the spring semester, which I viewed as an opportunity to learn more about
		and grow my experience in public speaking. I’ve been doing this job for almost two years now, and I’ve learned a
		lot! The following summer I bounced around; I started as an Orientation Leader in the orientation program. While
		this was an interesting position that allowed for a lot of creativity, it wasn’t the best fit for me. I ended up
		leaving the position in favor of one as an Emergency Medical Technician for the remainder of the summer. I
		enjoyed this job as it was always something new, and incredibly hands-on. Following my Junior year, I took a
		part-time position/internship with the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Rochester, helping them conduct
		research and analyze data in order to make informed policy decisions. Who knows what I’ll do next!
