    <h2>Academics</h2>

    <p>I’ve taken a large variety of different classes here at University of Rochester, and some of them were easier
        than others. In the following paragraph I will describe some of the classes that were the most difficult for me.
        Artificial Intelligence was one of the most difficult classes I’ve taken at U of R, because there was a lot of
        dense material on the exams. Basic Neurobiology was also a very difficult class because of the large amount of
        dense material on the exams. For each of these two classes there were 4 units, and I think each unit could have
        been a class all its own.</p>
